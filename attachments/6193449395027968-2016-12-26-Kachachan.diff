 Guide to Programming with Music Blocks
 ======================================
-
+  
 Music Blocks is a programming environment for children interested in
-music and graphics. It expands upon Turtle Blocks in that it has a
+music and graphics. It expands upon Turtle Blocks by adding a 
 collection of features relating to pitch and rhythm.
 
 The Turtle Blocks guide is a good place to start learning about the
-basics. In this guide, we illustrate the music features walking the
+basics. In this guide, we illustrate the musical features by walking the
 reader through numerous examples.
