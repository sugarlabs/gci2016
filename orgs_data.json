A big part of this is the student workbook which needs art and writing. We also need some Python programming work for assisting teachers with setup functions, and most importantly general work on the game engine to get it ready.\n\nYour work could help thousands of other students get started with programming!\n\nVoxGL\n=====\nWe've been working on an experimental new web-based game engine for Minecraft-like games called VoxGL. You can help get this new game engine ready for the masses!\n\nGame Networking\n===============\nOur game network suite could use a lot of work, from the web-based social platform for players to find each other to real-time network libraries there's still much to be done. \n\nWebsite Work\n============\nWe're pretty proud of https://gci.copyleftgames.org/ which was designed by both mentors and Google Code-in students in previous years, but there's still some work to be done. You can work on the web-based tools including our chat room, code editor, and Linux shell to improve the experience for all students.\n\nWe encourage students to suggest features for our website which can be made into Google Code-in tasks as well!",

What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?\n\n# Minimal Engine\n\nOur engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible. It even excludes such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single Gradle command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.",

SCoRe group has been a pioneer in cooperating with Internet Society (ISOC), Swedish Agency for International Development Cooperation (Sida)/The Department for Research Cooperation (SAREC), The Swedish Program for Information and Communication Technology in Developing Regions (Spider) and Information Society Innovation Fund (ISIF) in the area of computer science by establishing several interesting ICT research projects. These projects are considered to be the benchmarks of such projects in the World.",

            "description": "[Zulip](https://www.zulip.org) is a powerful, open source group chat application.  It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or at companies) collaborate effectively.  Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, audible notifications, missed-message emails, desktop apps, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulip.org/features.html) -- essentially everything you might want.\r\n\r\nUnlike Slack, it\u2019s open source and has a welcoming community of over 150 volunteer contributors.  Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a web version, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows.  And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\r\n\r\nZulip is known for its extensive developer documentation (65,000 words and growing!), code quality, and [tooling](https://blog.zulip.org/2016/10/13/static-types-in-python-oh-mypy/), and thus is a great project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.\r\n\r\nWe have tons of tasks across all parts of the Zulip project, and we're especially excited about expanding Zulip's library of bots and integrations!",
